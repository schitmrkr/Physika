### Columb's Law;

Force between two point charge.

$$
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

#### Electric Field (E):

Force per unit charge.

$$
E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{k Q}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

#### Electric Potential (V):

Work done per unit charge to move it in a field.

$$
V =  \frac{k Q}{r}
$$

#### Potential Energy (U):

$$
U = qV
$$

#### Superposition principle:

If multiple charges exists, total E or V is the vector sum of individual E or V.
