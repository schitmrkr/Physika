#### Fields in Matter

In vaccum, Maxwell's equation results in an electromagnetic wave. Now we consider them in materials.

**Polarization**

$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}
$$

Polarization is the seperation of electric charges in a material, creating tiny _dipoles_ that align with an applied electric field. _Dipoles_ are pairs of opposite charges separated by a small distance.

Polarization occurs when an external electric field causes positive and negative charges in a material to seperate slightly, forming electric dipoles that partially oppose the applied field inside the material.

Electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ accounts for both the free space field and material response: $\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}$, where $\mathbf{P}$ is polarization density.

In vaccum, $\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}$, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
